# p2pfilesync
This project allows users to install client code on their machines which will allow you to drag and drop files which will automatically be synced to the other computers on the network.

Currently the only file conflict it resolves is files of the same name, choosing the file on the network over the local file, assuming that files over the network are newer versions.
